## Project Requirements  

1. Choose a theme for your game! I chose a music theme! YAY!

3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will click on.

4. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

    a. If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

    b. As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

5. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
